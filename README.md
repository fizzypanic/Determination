# Determination
Adds the Determination origin to the Origins mod.  

This adds a new Undertale inspired origin. Maybe more will come, dunno.

**Determination Origin:**

*A pacifist at heart. You don't like hurting anyone, no matter what they've done.*

:green_circle: **Pure Determination:** You start off with more hearts than usual, thanks to your pure determination. (5+ Hearts)

:green_circle: **Training:** You've trained with Undyne and you're now faster than most. (0.15+ Speed)

:green_circle: **Last Stand:** Maybe with what little power you have... You can SAVE something else? (Regeneration 2 for 15 seconds every 2 Minutes and 30 Seconds.)

:yellow_circle: **Vegetarian:** You can no longer eat any type of meat.

:yellow_circle: **Pacifist:** You don't like killing, nor damaging anything, as so, you are really weak. (Weakness 1 PERMANENTLY.)

:red_circle: **Genocide Runs:** Your past loops through the Underground still haunt you. The past tends to come with bloody hands. (Sleep is disabled.)

:red_circle: **Trauma in Hotland:** The damage Hotland left on your nerves is still felt to this day, even if you're an entire universe away. (25%+ More damage from fire.)

*(This does not need to be unzipped.)*
